Modify previous HomeTask2 and create a following hierarchy 
2. Create superclass Engine and subclasses CombustionEngine, ElectricEngine
and HybridEngine. 
3. Create class Manufacture, with all setters and getters.
4. Create superclass Vehicle with abstract method ShowCharacteristics(). 
Create three subclasses ICEV, BEV, HybridV.
5. Each subclass of class Vehicle should have attribute of class Manufacture 
and Engine. 
6. Create arrays of Vechicle which contains objects of ICEV, BEV, HybridV.
7. Use method ShowCharacteristics() to demonstrate result. 
8. Please provide link to your GitHub with the solution. Additionally, to the 
solution it should contain readme with you matriculation number, solution 
project short description with indication of the development environment.

**Short Description:**
The code is a class definition for an Engine object.The class has three fields: String, double, and int.The constructor of the class takes in two parameters: String and double.It also takes in an int as its cost parameter.
The getEngineitems() method returns the string that is passed into it as a parameter (the engine items).The getSpecialid() method returns the value of the special ID field which is passed into it as a parameter (in this case, 0).The getcost() method returns the value of the cost field which is passed into it as a parameter (in this case, 10).
This code is meant to create a new instance of the Engine class with some values.
This code is trying to create three different types of engines, each with a specific type of fuel.This code is using the super keyword in order to inherit from the Engine class and then use that class's constructor parameters for its own.
The first engine will be an electric engine, which uses electricity as its fuel source.
It will have a cost of 100 and a special ID of 1.
The second engine will be a combustion engine, which uses gasoline as its fuel source.
It will have a cost of 200 and a special ID of 2.
The third engine will be hybrid, which has both gasoline and electricity as fuels sources but also has some other features not found on either one alone (such as regenerative braking).
It will have a cost of 300 and a special ID 3
This code is used to create a class hierarchy for three different types of engines.
